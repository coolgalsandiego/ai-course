    "With chat completion, you can simulate a back-and-forth conversation with an AI agent. This is of course useful for creating chat bots, but it can also be used for creating autonomous agents that can complete business processes, generate code, and more. As the primary model type provided by OpenAI, Google, Mistral, Facebook, and others, chat completion is the most common AI service that you will add to your Semantic Kernel project.\n",
    "\n",
    "When picking out a chat completion model, you will need to consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What modalities does the model support (e.g., text, image, audio, etc.)?\n",
    "* Does it support function calling?\n",
    "* How fast does it receive and generate tokens?\n",
    "* How much does each token cost?\n",

    "Let's get started with the necessary configuration to run Semantic Kernel. For Notebooks, we require a `.env` file with the proper settings for the model you use. Create a new file named `.env` and place it in this directory. Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file from this directory and paste it into the `.env` file that you just created.\n",
    "\n",
    ">NOTE: Please make sure to include `GLOBAL_LLM_SERVICE` set to either OpenAI, AzureOpenAI, or HuggingFace in your .env file. If this setting is not included, the Service will default to AzureOpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Azure OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "Add your [Azure Open AI Service key](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-studio) settings to the `.env` file in the same folder:\n",

    "AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=\"...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The names should match the names used in the `.env` file, as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Tip: There are three methods to supply the required information to AI services. You may either provide the information directly through the constructor, set the necessary environment variables, or create a .env file within your project directory containing the environment variables.\n",
