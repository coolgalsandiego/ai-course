    "The `Model Context Protocol` (`MCP`) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between `LLM` applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, `MCP` provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.\n",

    "* MCP Hosts: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP\n",
    "* MCP Clients: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers\n",
    "* MCP Servers: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol\n",
    "* Local Data Sources: Your computerâ€™s files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access\n",
